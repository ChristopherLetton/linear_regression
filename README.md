Description:
This file contains data about flights leaving from JKF ariport between Nov -January. Taxi-Out prediction has been an important concept as it helps in calculating Runway time and directly impact the cost of the flight.
Taxi-out refers to the time a plane spends moving on the airport's taxiways from its gate to the runway prior to takeoff. 
During this time, the plane is under the control of the airport's ground traffic control and may have to wait for other planes to clear the runway or for air traffic control to clear it for takeoff. 
The length of the taxi-out time can vary depending on a number of factors, including the size and type of plane, the traffic congestion at the airport, and the weather conditions.
Taxi-out time is an important factor in calculating the overall runway time for a flight, as longer taxi-out times can increase fuel consumption, affect the scheduling of other flights, and negatively impact the efficiency of an airline's operations. 
That's why accurate taxi-out prediction is crucial for airlines to minimize costs and optimize their operations.
